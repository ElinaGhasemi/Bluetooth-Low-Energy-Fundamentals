Summary of Exercise 1.

This exercise enabled me to test a Bluetooth LE connection.

After Building and flashing the application to my device (My device is nrf5340dk_nrf5340): 

1. LED1 blinking on my device, which means the advertising was successful
2. The log output looks like this: 

*** Booting Zephyr OS build v3.2.99-ncs2 ***
Starting Bluetooth Peripheral LBS example
I: 2 Sectors of 4096 bytes
I: alloc wra: 0, f58
I: data wra: 0, 140
Bluetooth initialized
Advertising successfully started

3. After pressing the SCAN button from the nRF Connect for Mobile app, the device's name (Nordic_LBS) will appear. 

4. Chose Nordic_LBS and press CONNECT

5. LED2 on my device is on (the connection has been established)

6. I could read the status of button 1 using the “Button” Characteristic: 

6.1 By pressing the single down-arrow icon (the “Value” tab in my “Button” Characteristic), I could receive and view the button 1 status. 

6.2 By pressing the icon with several down-arrows, I could enable notifications regarding this Characteristic to be pushed to my app

Now, if I press button 1 on my Nordic board, the value will change to 0X1 (although in Nordic course, they mentioned the value would change to  “Button pressed”)

7. By pressing the up arrow icon next to the LED characteristic, I could toggle LED 3. 

In Nordic course by seleting ON and then SEND, you could turn on the LED but in my app I had write the value 0x01 to turn on and 0x0 to turn of it.
