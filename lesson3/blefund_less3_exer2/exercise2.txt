In step 12 of the exercise, it was mentioned that to configure the application to enable data length extension, we need to add the following lines to the prj.conf file:

CONFIG_BT_USER_DATA_LEN_UPDATE=y
CONFIG_BT_CTLR_DATA_LENGTH_MAX=251
CONFIG_BT_BUF_ACL_RX_SIZE=251
CONFIG_BT_BUF_ACL_TX_SIZE=251
CONFIG_BT_L2CAP_TX_MTU=247


At the end of this exercise, there was a note about the nRF5340 DK platform, which is my platform as well:

"nRF5340 DK: Note that if you look at the solution for this exercise, you probably put all your configurations into your prj.conf. In the solution project, lesson3/blefund_less3_exer2/boards, you will see the files nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp.conf and nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp_ns.conf. Depending on which target you are building for, either of these files will be included as the the config file if you are using the nRF5340 DK. The prj.conf file will not be included in the build if a <BOARD_NAME>.conf is present in the boards folder."


With this note, I added the boards folder to my project, but still, in the terminal, my data length did not extend to 251/27 bytes. I compared my project with the solution presented and noticed there is another folder named child_image with two files: hci_ipc.conf and hci_rpmsg.conf. Both files have lines for increasing data length:

CONFIG_BT_CTLR_DATA_LENGTH_MAX=251
CONFIG_BT_BUF_ACL_RX_SIZE=251
CONFIG_BT_BUF_ACL_TX_SIZE=251
CONFIG_BT_MAX_CONN=2

After adding this folder, the data length extended to 251/27 bytes.
